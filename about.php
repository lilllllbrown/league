    <h3>ABOUT THE GAME</h3>
    <p> League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena, real-time 
        strategy video game developed and published by Riot Games. Players 
        assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" 
        with unique abilities and battles against a team of other players or 
        computer-controlled champions. Each League of Legends match is discrete, 
        with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength 
        by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.</p>
    <h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
    <p> We created a website which simulates events in order to enhance one's 
        strategy as a "summoner" and enable you to track the factors that 
        contribute to the strength of each "champions," a feature which the game 
        does not generate on its own.</p>
